# Hello

I have made a Health app (For mumbai location) with follwing features
* user can enter his basic details
* He can enter the medicines that he takes
* He can enter the doc visits along with the necessary images for the same
* He can press the help button and get nearby hospitals (Please not hospitals are from Mumbai area only, so you might have to zoom out to see the markers on map)
* The medicine and doc info is fetched from an api while hospitals are cached in app



# Note 
*  You can use username 'reviwer-support@udacity.com' & password 'hello' to sign in. This is a offline check & does not use a api call
*  I have reused my old project and updated it to match the rubric. It fetches list of docs and medicine from an api.
*  My focus has been on users profile, medicine & doc info screens, Other parts of app are not updated to match the ruberic
*  There is also a help, pedometer & heart rate functionality in the app, Those parts have not been updated to match ruberic as I have 4 features in profile, medicine & doc info & login screens
*  Have used library for pedometer and heartrate.
*  maps api key is not pushed to github
